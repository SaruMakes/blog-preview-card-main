## Foreword

I'm a very new and inexperienced front-end developer - hell, it feels wild to even call myself that already - who is trying to learn as much as possible from each project I take on. In order to organise my thoughts, and to try to make my approach as systematic as possible, I try to keep a journal of what I'm doing along the way, to take time to stop and review what I've done and what I'll be doing next.

I'm unfamiliar with the usual manner of writing README's like this, so the overall style and tone might be different from what more experienced readers might expect. Since this is as much a journal to myself, as it is a description for you as a reader, you might notice that my language will at times be quite conversational. You might also see me writing things that might be entirely obvious or completely wrong. 

This is all part of the process for me, and you, my dear reader, are simply offered the chance to get a glimpse into my thoughts on this entire project.

## Project Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Initial thoughts

Looking at the Figma design file, I'm first of all seeing one main component, the blog preview card. Inside it, I'm envisioning perhaps three main containers: one for the image, one for the text content (with multiple nested containers within) and one for the "footer" with the userimage and name. I might use flexbox, but I'll have to see what I end up using, as I make my way through the coding.

I'll be trying to build this using a Mobile-first workflow, which I will read up on before starting on the coding itself. Judging from the design files, there will not be a massive difference between the mobile and desktop versions. 

The design specifies that there will need to be an active state, when you hover over the blog title, which will be a very interesting challenge. I have never created a component like this before, so I will be needing to study how to this. At first glance, I can see that the active state needs to change color of the headline, as well as having the entire component seem as if it is lifting off of the background, with the shadow moving further "away". Perhaps this will require some sort of animation.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

LEARNED:
CSS variables - find examples (used it for colors)
Mobile-first 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
